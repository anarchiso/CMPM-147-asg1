# CMPM-147-asg1
first assignment for CMPM147 at UCSC, a sound visualizer using particles

This sketch draws a lot of triangles. I used the amplitude to make the sketch react to music. The size of the particles is mapped to the amplitude of the sound file so that the particles are larger the louder the sound is. One of the assigned readings for this assignment came from the book "Generative Art: a Practical Guide Using Processing" by Matt Pearson. The introduction of that book began with a quote from Alan Watts which I thought was pretty neat. I used it in the sketch.  You must be patient as the music develops and the particles grow to be able to read these wise words. If you are impatient maybe clicking on the screen more might help.
